# multivariate-analysis
the multivariate analysis compares different rows and columns for beat accuracy  eg:knn imputer in univariate analysis it only compares with the same columns eg mean or median for numbers

what is KNN Imputer??
credits:bit.ly/3w34Wt7
multivariate analysis techniques Imputation for completing missing values using k-Nearest Neighbors. Each sample's missing values are imputed using the mean value from n_neighbors nearest neighbors found in the training set. Two samples are close if the features that neither is missing are close.


what is MICE Algorithm?
credits:bit.ly/38SL2ce
MICE is a multiple imputation method used to replace missing data values in a data set under certain assumptions about the data missingness mechanism (e.g., the data are missing at random, the data are missing completely at random).this works best on missing at random
